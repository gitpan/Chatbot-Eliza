README file for Chatbot::Eliza version 0.31

This module implements the classic Eliza algorithm. The original Eliza
program was written by Joseph Weizenbaum and described in the
Communications of the ACM in 1967. Eliza is a mock Rogerian
psychotherapist. It prompts for user input, and uses a simple
transformation algorithm to change user input into a follow-up question.
The program is designed to give the appearance of understanding.

This program is a faithful implementation of the program described by
Weizenbaum. It uses a simplified script language (devised by Charles
Hayden). The content of the script is the same as Weizenbaum's.

This module encapsulates the Eliza algorithm in the form of an object.
This makes the functionality easy to include in larger programs,
including CGI scripts for the World Wide Web. 

USAGE:

This is all you need to do to launch a simple Eliza session:

    use Chatbot::Eliza;

    $mybot = new Chatbot::Eliza;
    $mybot->command_interface;

When creating an Eliza object, you can specify a name and an
alternative scriptfile:

    $bot = new Chatbot::Eliza "Brian", "myscript.txt";

You can use any of the internal functions in a calling program.
The code below takes an arbitrary string and retrieves the reply
from the Eliza object:

     my $string = "I have too many problems.";
     my $reply  = $mybot->transform( $string );

Complete usage notes are in the HTML and text documentation in 
the doc/ directory.  These are right from the embedded POD. 


INSTALLATION:
                                                                      
To install this module, you need to run:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install         


WHAT'S NEW?         

Version 0.31
------------

The module is now installable, just like any other self-respecting
CPAN module.  

Version 0.30
------------

This is the first module I've ever submitted to CPAN.
I'm curious to hear any comments or criticism,
or ways to improve this module in future versions.
