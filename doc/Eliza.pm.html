DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
This module implements the classic Eliza algorithm. 
The original Eliza program was written by Joseph 
Weizenbaum and described in the Communications 
of the ACM in 1967.  Eliza is a mock Rogerian 
psychotherapist.  It prompts for user input, 
and uses a simple transformation algorithm
to change user input into a follow-up question.  
The program is designed to give the appearance 
of understanding.  
<p>This program is a faithful implementation of the program 
described by Weizenbaum.  It uses a simplified script 
language (devised by Charles Hayden).  The content 
of the script is the same as Weizenbaum's. 
<p>This module encapsulates the Eliza algorithm 
in the form of an object.  This makes
the functionality easy to use in larger programs,
including CGI programs for the World Wide Web.

<A NAME="Eliza.pm_usage_0">
USAGE</A>
</H1>
This is all you need to do to launch a simple
Eliza session:
<p>
<XMP>
        use Chatbot::Eliza;
        $mybot = new Chatbot::Eliza;
        $mybot->command_interface;

</XMP>
<p>You can also customize certain features of the 
session:
<p>
<XMP>
        $myotherbot = new Chatbot::Eliza;
        $myotherbot->name( "Hortense" );
        $myotherbot->debug( 1 );
        $myotherbot->command_interface;

</XMP>
<p>These lines set the name of the bot to be
``Hortense'' and turn on the debugging output.
<p>When creating an Eliza object, you can specify
a name and an alternative scriptfile:
<p>
<XMP>
        $bot = new Chatbot::Eliza "Brian", "myscript.txt";

</XMP>
<p>If you don't specify a script file, then the
Eliza module will initialize the new Eliza
object with a default script that the module
contains within itself. 
<p>You can use any of the internal functions in
a calling program.  The code below takes an 
arbitrary string and retrieves the reply from 
the Eliza object:
<p>
<XMP>
        my $string = "I have too many problems.";
        my $reply  = $mybot->transform( $string );

</XMP>
<p>You can easily create two bots, each with a different
script, and see how they interact:
<p>
<XMP>
        use Chatbot::Eliza
        my ($harry, $sally, $he_says, $she_says);
        $sally = new Chatbot::Eliza "Harry", "histext.txt";
        $harry = new Chatbot::Eliza "Sally", "hertext.txt";
        $he_says  = "I am sad.";
        while (1) {
                $she_says = $sally->_transform( $he_says );
                print $sally->name, $she_says, "\n";
        
                $he_says  = $harry->_transform( $she_says );
                print $harry->name, $he_says, "\n";
        }

</XMP>
<p>Of course, as with the original Eliza program,
the magic of the algorithm is really in the script.

MAIN DATA MEMBERS</A>
</H1>
Each Eliza object uses the following data structures 
to hold the script data in memory:
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>%decomplist</STRONG> </H2>
<STRONG>hash:</STRONG> the set of keywords; <STRONG>values:</STRONG> strings containing 
the decomposition rules. 
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>%reasmblist</STRONG> </H2>
<STRONG>hash:</STRONG> a set of values which are each the join 
of a keyword and a corresponding decomposition rule;  
<STRONG>values:</STRONG>  the set of possible reassembly statements 
for that keyword and decomposition rule.  
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>%keyranks</STRONG></H2>
<STRONG>hash:</STRONG> the set of keywords; <STRONG>values:</STRONG> the ranks for each keyword
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>@quit</STRONG></H2>
``quit'' words -- that is, words the user might use 
to try to exit the program.  
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>@initial</STRONG></H2>
Possible greetings for the beginning of the program.
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>@final</STRONG></H2>
Possible farewells for the end of the program.
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>%pre</STRONG></H2>
<STRONG>hash:</STRONG> words which are replaced before any transformations;
<STRONG>values:</STRONG> the respective replacement words.
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>%post</STRONG></H2>
<STRONG>hash:</STRONG> words which are replaced after the transformations 
and after the reply is constructed; <STRONG>values</STRONG>: the respective 
replacement words.
 
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>%synon</STRONG>	</H2>
<STRONG>hash:</STRONG> words which are found in decomposition rules;
<STRONG>values:</STRONG> words which are treated just like their 
corresponding synonyms during matching of decomposition
rules. 
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>@memory</STRONG></H2>
An array of user-input strings which are 
remembered and may be used at random moments 
in a dialogue.

<A NAME="Eliza.pm_methods_0">
METHODS</A>
</H1>
<p>
<H2> my <STRONG>$chatterbot</STRONG> = new Chatbot::Eliza;</H2>
<STRONG>new</STRONG> creates a new Eliza object.  This method
also calls the internal <STRONG> _initialize</STRONG> method, which in turn
calls the <STRONG>parse_script_data</STRONG> method, which initializes
the script data.  
<p>
<H2> my <STRONG>$chatterbot</STRONG> = new Chatbot::Eliza 'Ahmad', 'myfile.txt';</H2>
The eliza object defaults to the name ``Eliza'', and it
contains default script data within itself.  However,
using the syntax above, you can specify an alternative
name and an alternative script file. 
<p>See the method <STRONG>parse_script_data</STRONG>. for a description
of the format of the script file. 
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>$chatterbot</STRONG>-&gt;command_interface;</H2>
<STRONG>command_interface</STRONG> opens an interactive session with 
the Eliza object, just like the original Eliza program.
<p>If you want to design your own session format, then 
you can write your own while loop and your own functions
for prompting for and reading user input, and use the 
<STRONG>transform</STRONG> method to generate Eliza's responses. 
<p>But if you're lazy and you want to skip all that,
then just use <STRONG>command_interface</STRONG>.  It's all done for you. 
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>$string</STRONG> = preprocess(<STRONG>$string</STRONG>);</H2>
<STRONG>preprocess</STRONG> applies simple substitution rules to the input string.
Mostly this is to catch varieties in spelling, misspellings,
contractions and the like.  
<p><STRONG>preprocess</STRONG> is called from within the <STRONG>transform</STRONG> method.  
It is applied to user-input text, BEFORE any processing,
and before a reassebly statement has been selected. 
<p>It uses the array 
<A HREF="Eliza.pm.html#Eliza.pm_pre_0"><STRONG>%pre</STRONG></A>
, which is created 
during the parse of the script.
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>$string</STRONG> = postprocess(<STRONG>$string</STRONG>);</H2>
<STRONG>postprocess</STRONG> applies simple substitution rules to the 
reassembly rule.  This is where all the ``I'''s and ``you'''s 
are exchanged.  <STRONG>postprocess</STRONG> is called from within the
<STRONG>transform</STRONG> function.
<p>It uses the array 
<A HREF="Eliza.pm.html#Eliza.pm_post_0"><STRONG>%post</STRONG></A>
, created during the parse of the script.
<p>
<H2> if (<STRONG>$self</STRONG>-&gt;_testquit(<STRONG>$user_input</STRONG>) ) { ... }</H2>
<STRONG> _testquit</STRONG> detects words like ``bye'' and ``quit'' and returns
true if it finds one of them as the first word in the sentence. 
<p>These words are listed in the script, under the keyword ``quit''. 
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>$reply</STRONG> = <STRONG>$chatterbot</STRONG>-&gt;transform( <STRONG>$string</STRONG> );</H2>
<STRONG>transform</STRONG> applies transformation rules to the user input
string.  It invokes <STRONG>preprocess</STRONG>, does transformations, 
then invokes <STRONG>postprocess</STRONG>.  It returns the tranformed 
output string, called <STRONG><STRONG>$reasmb</STRONG></STRONG>.  
<p>
<H2> <STRONG>$self</STRONG>-&gt;parse_script_data;</H2>
<STRONG>parse_script_data</STRONG> is invoked from the <STRONG> _initialize</STRONG> method.
It opens the scriptfile, if any, and reads in the script data.  
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="Eliza.pm_format_0">
FORMAT OF THE SCRIPT FILE</A>
</H1>
This module includes a default script file within itself, 
so it is not necessary to explicitly specify a script file 
when instantiating an Eliza object.  
<p>Each line in the script file can specify a key,
a decomposition rule, or a reassembly rule.
<p>key: remember 5
  decomp: * i remember *
    reasmb: Do you often think of (2) ?
    reasmb: Does thinking of (2) bring anything else to mind ?
  decomp: * do you remember *
    reasmb: Did you think I would forget (2) ?
    reasmb: What about (2) ?
    reasmb: goto what
pre: equivalent alike
synon: belief feel think believe wish
<p>The number after the key specifies the rank.
If a user's input contains the keyword, then
the ``transform'' function will try to match
one of the decomposition rules for that keyword.
If one matches, then it will select one of
the reassembly rules at random.  The number
(2) here means "use whatever set of words
matched the second asterisk in the decomposition
rule." 
<p>If you specify a list of synonyms for a word,
the you should use a <STRONG>@ </STRONG>when you use that
word in a decomposition rule:
<p>
<XMP>
  decomp: * i @belief i *
    reasmb: Do you really think so ?
    reasmb: But you are not sure you (3).

</XMP>
<p>Otherwise, the script will never check to see
if there are any synonyms for that keyword. 
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="Eliza.pm_how_0">
HOW THE SCRIPTFILE IS PARSED</A>
</H1>
Each line in the script file contains an ``entrytype''
(key, decomp, synon) and an ``entry'', separated by
a colon.  In turn, each ``entry'' can itself be 
composed of a ``key'' and a ``value'', separated by
a space.  The <STRONG>parse_script_data</STRONG> function
parses each line out, and splits the ``entry'' and
``entrytype'' portion of each line into two variables,
``<STRONG>$entry</STRONG>'' and ``<STRONG>$entrytype</STRONG>''. 
<p>Next, it uses the string ``<STRONG>$entrytype</STRONG>'' to determine 
what sort of stuff to expect in the ``<STRONG>$entry</STRONG>'' variable,  
if anything, and parses it accordingly.  In some cases,
there is no second level of key-value pair, so the function
does not even bother to isolate or create ``<STRONG>$key</STRONG>'' and ``<STRONG>$value</STRONG>''. 
<p>``<STRONG>$key</STRONG>'' is always a single word.  ``<STRONG>$value</STRONG>'' can be null, 
or one single word, or a string composed of several words, 
or an array of words.  
<p>Based on all these entries and keys and values,
the function creates two giant hashes:
<STRONG><STRONG>%decomplist</STRONG></STRONG>, which holds the decomposition rules for
each keyword, and <STRONG><STRONG>%reasmblist</STRONG></STRONG>, which holds the 
reassembly phrases for each decomposition rule. 
It also creates <STRONG>%keyranks</STRONG>, which holds the ranks for
each key.  
<p>Five other arrays are created: B<<STRONG>%pre</STRONG>, <STRONG>%post</STRONG>, 
<STRONG>%synon</STRONG>, <STRONG>@initial</STRONG>,&gt; and 
<A HREF="Eliza.pm.html#Eliza.pm_final_0"><STRONG>@final</STRONG></A>
