This module is still officially an alpha.  This means that
it may contain some stupid bugs.  However, it does generally work.  

Please don't hesitate to e-mail me if you run into any 
problems with the Eliza functionality.  I'm also to curious
to hear about any successful applications.  If you have
suggestions, please pass them along. 

I am currently looking for help with the German-language script
from a native German speaker.
