This module is still officially an alpha.  This means that
it may contain some stupid bugs, and it's functionality 
is not 100% complete.

However, the functionality is 95% complete, and it does 
generally work.  

Please don't hesitate to e-mail me if you run into any 
problems with the Eliza functionality.  I'm also to curious
to hear about any successful applications.  If you have
suggestions, please pass them along.
